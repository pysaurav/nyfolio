      <description>Sleep is one of our basic daily needs. We all spend a substantial amount of our lifetime sleeping. For a common person, one-third of our overall lifetime is spent sleeping. While it is a physical need and keeps us healthy, too much sleep can be a barrier in our productivity and what we can achieve in our life.&#xA;Most of us people follow the traditional eight hours of monophasic sleep cycle.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Why dont we have wireless electricity yet?&amp;rdquo;, the question bother me now.&#xA;Nikola Tesla, a fascinating name and an enigmatic person. Until recently, I always portrayed him as a mad scientist and a thinker. A man sitting under the wWrdenclyffe Tower always popped up in my brain. Apart from other things, he is ubdoubtedly one of the greatest minds the world has witnessed since its inception.&#xA;He patented an idea in 1905 titled &amp;ldquo;ART OF TRANSMITTING ELECTRICITY THROUGH NATURAL MEDIUM&amp;rdquo;, more than a century later we still have not been able to implement it.</description>
